The application have only routes working and that's it for now. There's poor tries to handle some data in redux in ./components/users/RegisterForm.js but with no success.
It's mix between .ts and .js files. Redux is with .ts files and components are .js but will equalize everything to .ts.

The server have authentication system with jwt and works perfect except there's no logout. When token for the session expires then the token is invalid and that's the logout :) .
